Our 'Dirt and Grime Assessment' will tell you if you need your windows cleaned or not. We analyze the layer of dust and other grime that has settled onto the window surface. 

Typically if there is just light pollen, I don't recommend a full cleaning if there hasn't been one recently. We sometimes will give a few free windows away just to show how much better your windows are though when you keep the pollen off.

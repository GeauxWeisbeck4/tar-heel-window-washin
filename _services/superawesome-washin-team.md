We have the best Window Washin' team you could put together really. Lisa and Andrew are MAJOR lovebirds and have been together for two years. They both have a really solid work ethic - like they work all the time. 

Financial hardhsip has struck us both during the last eight months and we have struggled majorly to get by. We need to pay our bills, so we thought we'd use a hard work ethic skill to earn the money we need to pay our bills. We have no problem working or working hard - it's when people don't make it easy for us to work, we can't work hard.

Hire us for the hardest working, most awesome team in the whole damn state!

# Objectives

Window Washin' refers to washing residence windows - we do auto window washin' as well when requested. Check out our auto-detailing section.

1. According to the International Window Washin' Standards Board: the objective of workin' your ass off while washin' windows:
2. To provide the shiniest and cleanest of windows. We can't guarantee that your cat won't try and jump through your window because he thinks it's completely clear - our cats have done it - more than once!
3. We always provide the highest level of service, period!

## Level of Dirt and Grime

We have to assess the amount of dirt and grime before we mix our window washing solution. There is an art to removing the dirt and grime in a way that doesn't scratch the window or just smear streaks into it. There are a few factors that can make or break a good window wash by not correctly assessing the window's dirt condition.

> The ingredients of dirt and grime are the predictive value for how much window solution to make.

"Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements." 
- Fancy Legal Mumbo Jumbo that says don't hide anything about what you do because it can affect your client. Always set expectations about something that might not meet the client's expectations - it lessons the burden of disappointment a little bit.

### Verifiability

Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity. We can always create an invoice or receipt to record your service payment.

### Comparability

Comparability is the uniform application of window washin' methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of comparing two different cleans at different times.

### Understandability

Understandability means that the terms of our service and contract should be layed out as simple as possible so any party who is taking over a contract can easily understand what his legal obligation is.
Timeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made. I think some people get timeliness confused with not getting paid on time or something - it is just about getting information to the person in time for them to make the best decision possible.

## Statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. You can see how a typical day of cash flows looks at Tar Heel Window Washin' below. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

| Cash Inflow | Outflow  | Opening Balance |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| _Saturday_  | `Sunday` | **Monday**      |
| 1000        | 450      | 550             |

**Example 1:** in the beginning of August, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:

- Cash inflow: $20
- Cash outflow:$7
- Opening balance: $5
- Closing balance: $20 â€“ $7 + $5 = $18

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

## Statement of financial position (balance sheet)

The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement.

- **fixed assets**
  - property
  - building
  - equipment (such as factory machinery)
- **intangible assets**
  - copyrights
  - trademarks
  - patents
    - pending
    - international
- goodwill

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.

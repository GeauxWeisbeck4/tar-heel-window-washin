It was announced late on Thursday evening, July 22nd, that Tar Heel Window Washin' is teaming up with Tar Heel Dev Studio to bring the service from the digital agency platform and bring it to labor work. Tar Heel Dev Studio is excited with this partnership and the companies will essentially operate as one - with Lisa managing the company on Window Washin' and Andrew managing the Dev Studio side, there is greater balance and leadership for the organizations together.

This is our thought process and we will continue to tinker with our business model as we figure out what best serves us and our stakeholders in all of our transactions and projects.
